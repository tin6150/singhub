BootStrap: yum
#OSVersion: 7
OSVersion: 6

# If you want the updates (available at the bootstrap date) to be installed
# inside the container during the bootstrap instead of the General Availability
# point release (7.x) then uncomment the following line
#UpdateURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/updates/$basearch/


%runscript
    echo "This is what happens when you run the container..."

%post
    echo "Hello from inside the container"
    yum -y --releasever=6 install vim-minimal
    yum -y --releasever=6 install coreutils
