# This ansible playbook get executed by Vagran provision 
# (after the shell block, multiple provision blocks are executed sequentially)

#
# yaml quirky: 
# --- means start of doc
# ... means end of doc (but often not seen)
# like python, space matter!  it dictates the hierarchy
#    but the "-" to define list has to stick out for visibility.  this make shifting block level a real PITA  !!!! :( 
#    Not sure when need to use "-" and when don't.  Best to use 4 space tab even for "-" and the next/prev block
#    especially when the "when" clause is at the end of the block!!

## Ansible Wisdom (for now)
## - the way how OS platform/version is handled, the syntax needed to detect them
##   and the number of things that are still platform specific 
##    + yum vs apt vs dnf, 
##    + EPEL, AppImage??
##    + yum specific argument that is not supported in package module
##    + package name is that specific to platform (eg kernel-header vs linux-header)
##   it is art to separate out OS specific stuff at the right time on in the hierarchy.
##   Cuz, the anoying thing is that the important code of logic flow may need to be split into two files or two blocks :(
##   On the flip side, the "when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian' is tested at the bottom, easy to miss!!

## ansible localhost -m setup # get list of vars/facts

#### This playbook is really old, monolything, and bring the worse out of yaml
#### but if split into multiple files, vagrant provision need to link many of them
#### For now, maintain as something light to apply to all VM
#### anything heavier should run the wsl_localhost playboook inside the host
