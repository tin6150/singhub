# yaml quirky: 
# --- means start of doc
# ... means end of doc (but often not seen)
# like python, space matter!  it dictates the hierarchy
#    but the "-" to define list has to stick out for visibility.  this make shifting block level a real PITA  !!!! :( 
# vi use
# : set shiftwidth=2 tabstop=4
